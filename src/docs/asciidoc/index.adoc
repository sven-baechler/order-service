== Introduction
The Java project "Order-Service" was developed as part of the "Software Development and Architecture" module at HSLU. The module "Software Architecture and Techniques" focuses on enhancing code quality, maintainability, stability, and other key aspects. To apply the concepts learned in the lectures, the existing Java project "Order-Service" was utilized as a refactoring project.

== System Context
The "Order-Service" is a microservice and is part of a "Filial-System". This service is responsible for managing the orders. This application subscribes to RabbitMQ queues, to which other services can send messages, and will be processed by the "Order-Service". More information about which queues this service can process are documented under the section API.

== API Documentation
The Application Programming Interface (API) in the Order-Service is implemented using RabbitMQ. RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker software that facilitates communication between different services and applications by sending and receiving messages through queues. The "Order-Service" provides different queues, which require different request JSON formats.

=== Order Create Queue
Queue name: `order.created`

This queue receives messages to create new orders. The interface is necessary to process and store orders from various points of sale centrally. The creation of a new order is performed asynchronously.

==== Required JSON Format

[source,json]
----
{
  "order": {
    "branchOfficeId": "5fc3aadb5b21bb774678adab",
    "sellerId": "5fc3aadb5b21bb774678adac",
    "customer": {
      "id": "5fc3aadb5b21bb774678adad",
      "name": "",
      "preName": "",
      "street": "",
      "zip": "",
      "city": ""
    },
    "datetime": null,
    "status": null,
    "entries": [
      {
        "articleId": "5fc3aadb5b21bb774678adae",
        "articleName": "",
        "amount": 0,
        "pricePerUnit": 0
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

=== Article Stock Updated
Queue name: `article.stock_updated`

This queue can be used when new articles have arrived in the warehouse. The added articles are searched for in all orders to check if they can now be delivered. If this is the case, the status of the article is updated accordingly. The execution is performed asynchronously.

Request JSON:
[source,json]
----
{
  "articleId": "12345",
  "amount": 10
}
----

=== Order-Item Update Status
Queue name: `order.item_update_status`

This queue updates the status of an item in an order. Subsequently, the entire order is checked. If all items are in the status "READY_TO_DELIVER", the overall order status can be updated to READY_TO_DELIVER. The process is done asynchronously.

Request JSON:
[source,json]
----
{
  "orderId": "1234",
  "articleId": "1234",
  "status": "READY_TO_DELIVER"
}
----

=== Order List Requested Queue
Queue name: `order.list_requested`

This queue is used to retrieve a list of all existing orders. An empty JSON is sent, as no specific parameters are required for the request. The response contains a list of orders in JSON format, where each order includes information such as ID, branch office ID, seller ID, customer, date, status, and entries. The request is processed synchronously and directly returns a response.
